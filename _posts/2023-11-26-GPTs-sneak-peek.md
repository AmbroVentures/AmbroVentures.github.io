# GPTs
Welcome to the fascinating realm of Generative Pre-trained Transformers, more commonly known as GPTs. These advanced artificial intelligence models, developed by OpenAI, have revolutionized the way we interact with technology, offering remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. As we stand on the brink of yet another exciting development, the imminent launch of the GPT Store promises to be a game-changer. This store will be a hub where innovators and creators, like ourself, can showcase and offer their unique GPT-based applications to the world. In this blog, we're thrilled to give you a sneak peek into the GPTs we've developed, well before they make their grand debut in the GPT store. Stay tuned for a journey into the future of AI-driven applications!

Our first batch of GPTs span a variety of categories from increasing your productivity to just having some fun.

## Productivity
Empowering Efficiency: Revolutionizing How You Process Information.

### Speed Reader

The Speed Reader family is a set of GPTs that will help you digest large amount of text faster. They are perfect for dealing with large articles or even entire documents.

* [Highlight!](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Ctc8vu1C5) will return the text as is, but **higlight** key term along the away to allow you to cross read a document faster while not loosing any context.
* [Summarize!](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-xmCLFGYtD) will boil the article or document down to the most relevant information.

If that's not enough, check out the next one in our list...

### TL;DR
__Too Long; Didn't Read__

Similar to the Speed Reader GPTs, this one will also save you a huge amount of time by radically reducing an article to a mere few sentences.

## Art

Is this Art or Fun? We couldn't agree. Anyway, this is one of the most intracte of our GPTs. It allows to generate fictional monster inspired by the style of Pokémon, ready for use in fangames. 
Not only does it generate breathtaking artwork, it also creates a name and lore for the Fakemon along with a detailed specification. 
It is even capable to ensure compatibility with Pokémon if asked to.

We have also made a derivative that can integrate with the [Essentials](https://essentialsdocs.fandom.com/wiki/Essentials_Docs_Wiki) Addon for [RPG Maker XP](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp) game engine. It's still a little bit rough around the edges but totally worth a try!

### RPG Graphics Maker
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbroVentures/AmbroVentures.github.io/main/assets/images/gpt-rpg-graphics.png =256x256)

In a similar category we have [RPG Graphics Maker](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-1BC1YggkV). It can generate detailed sceneries, characters and faces for your RPG. This is again catered to game developers using [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) or other similar game engines.

We are also working on an [RPG Sprite Maker](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-n9NCkn7Vr), but it seems that DALLE is strugling to generate sprite sheets. However, we haven't given up hope yet. We will keep working on it and let you know once it reaches a satisfying level.
